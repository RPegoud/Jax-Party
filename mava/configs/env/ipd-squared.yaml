# Defines the metric that will be used to evaluate the performance of the agent.
# This metric is returned at the end of an experiment and can be used for hyperparameter tuning.
eval_metric: episode_return

# Whether the environment observations encode implicit agent IDs. If True, the AgentID wrapper is not used.
# This should not be changed.
implicit_agent_id: False
# Whether or not to log the winrate of this environment. This should not be changed as not all
# environments have a winrate metric.
